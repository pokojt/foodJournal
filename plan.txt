1. Decide the MODEL. --> Meal. created with export class Meal
    DONE

2. Decide the ROOT COMPONENT. (AppComponent). What will this do?
    DONE - show list of meals

3. Decide other COMPONENTS.
    DONE - meal list component
    DONE - meal display component
    DONE - edit meal Component

  - to display meal details when clicked
      *I think for this I should make a separate component that only displays when the current meal is the selected meal. Similar to Edit meal.*

  - add meal component


  - pipe healthy/ not healthy / all






- I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with its name, calories and details.
- I want to view a list of only the names of the foods I have logged, and I want to be able to click on a name to view the details and calories for that food.
- I want to view either all foods, only unhealthy foods that are more than 300 calories, or only healthy foods that are less than 300 calories.
- I want to be able to click on a food and then edit its name, details or calories in case I decide to pretend my fries were only 100 calories instead of 365 calories.
